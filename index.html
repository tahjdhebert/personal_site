    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my personal website, hosted on Neocities</p>
    <p>As you can see there is not a lot here right now. That's because I'm learning!</p>

    <h2>Who Are You?</h2>
    <p>I'm Tahj, but you may know me as my usernames, th3lastlin3 or sssquidee. I'm a 21 year old computer science student<br>
        living in the Midwest in the United States. I'm hoping to complete my degree from Western Governor's University by May of 2024.<br>
        most of my interest is in software, but some future hardware projects I would like to work on are building a web server<br>
        using raspberry pi and building my own PC.</p>

    <h2>What's In Store?</h2>
    <p>This is where I plan on keeping track of my projects (both software and hardware)<br>
        as well as keeping track of the resources I use to learn computer science and IT. I<br>
        believe in interdisciplinary approaches to everything, so you won't just be finding tutorials<br>
        and curriculums here, but also the books I'm reading on computation history, ethics, culture<br>
        and more! Thanks for coming on this journey with me!
    </p>
